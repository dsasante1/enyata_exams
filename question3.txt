a. DOM

Document Object Manipulation is an interface. This interface exposes an html structure
and makes it available for manipulation by javascript dynamically. This adds a dynamic element
to a static website.

b. Promises
A Promise represent an alternative method executing javascript code. Javascript executes code
sequentially. A Promise makes javascript execution non sequential. This enables fast code
execution because expensive tasks are sent to a different execution path and when it is ready, it
is merged to from the main path. Mean while less expensive tasks are done by the main code execution
path.



c. Object oriented programming

Object oriented programming in javascript refers to a method of programming which makes it possible to
represent, identify and establish entities, relationships between entities and the duty of entities.


d. Callback

A Callback is a function nested in another function. In javascript functions can be used
as function arguments, nested in other functions. Nested functions are executed in the
outer function. Callbacks forces a nested function to wait for a task to finish before it continues.
